  - Weight
  - Temperature
  - Area
  - Volume

- **Key Functionality**:
  - Real-time conversion as users input values
  - Intuitive unit selection dropdowns
  - Swap units with a single click
  - Detailed conversion formula display
  - Error handling for invalid inputs

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used

- Next.js 15.2.4 latest
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Shadcn/UI Components

### Key Components

- Dynamic conversion logic
- Comprehensive unit conversion data structure
- Responsive and accessible UI
- Robust error handling

## Development Process

### Initial Approach

1. Choose Nextjs, shadcn and tailwind
